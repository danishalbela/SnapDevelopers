# ImageCompressor

ImageCompressor is a web application built to efficiently compress images to reduce file size while maintaining quality. This project was generated with Angular CLI version 17.0.8.

## Development server

To run the development server, follow these steps:

1. Run `ng serve` for a dev server.
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your web browser.
3. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

You can generate various components, directives, pipes, services, classes, guards, interfaces, enums, or modules using Angular CLI. Here's how:

- Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.
- Replace `component-name` with the name of the component you wish to generate.

## Build

To build the project, use the command `ng build`. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. This command prepares the application for deployment.

## Running unit tests

Unit tests can be executed using Karma. To run the unit tests, use the command `ng test`. This will initiate the test runner and execute the tests.

## Running end-to-end tests

End-to-end tests ensure the application works as expected in a real environment. To execute these tests, use the command `ng e2e`. Note that you may need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
